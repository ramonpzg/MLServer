title: "MLModel"
---

The `MLModel` class is the base class for all [custom inference runtimes](../../user-guide/custom).
It exposes the main interface that MLServer will use to interact with ML
models.

The bulk of its public interface are the `load()<mlserver.MLModel.load>`, 
`unload() <mlserver.MLModel.unload>` and `predict() <mlserver.MLModel.predict>` methods.
However, it also contains helpers with encoding / decoding of requests and
responses, as well as properties to access the most common bits of the model's
metadata.

When writing [custom runtimes](../../user-guide/custom), **this class should be
extended to implement your own load and predict logic**.
